## 1. Setting up your fork üç¥
---
*You only have to complete this first section once (in the beginning of the week)*

### Making the fork 
Just head over to the **public class'** GitHub repository and click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner.

After a few seconds you should be redirected to your fork, the top of your page should look something like this:

### Making a local clone of *your fork*
First, click on the green "Clone" button and copy the link that drops down. *Again, make sure you're on the page of your fork, not the class repository.* 

Once you have that, open your terminal or Git bash to clone your fork by runing the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/[YOUR USERNAME]/Week[NUMBER]_Public
```

### Adding an upstream

In order to keep your fork up to date with the class repository when we push new notebooks and files each day, you'll need to set up the original class repository as your "upstream". *Make sure you insert the link of the **class** repository and not your fork*

```
# First make sure you're in the right directory
cd Week[NUMBER]_Public
# Now add the upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/BeaverWorksMedlytics2020/Week[NUMBER]_Public
```

Make sure your origin and upstream are all set by running

```
git remote -v
```

You should see something like this where your origin is linked to your fork (as seen by your username) and upstream is set to the original class repository (as seen by BeaverWorksMedlytics2020)

```
origin  https://github.com/emilygtan/Week1_Public.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/emilygtan/Week1_Public.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/BeaverWorksMedlytics2020/Week1_Public (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/BeaverWorksMedlytics2020/Week1_Public (push)
```

## 2. Keeping your fork up to date
---
You've probably made changes to your exercise notebooks through Colab, so first you'll need to pull those updates to your local copy. Then you you can fetch the changes from upstream, merge those with your local master branch, and push the updated local branch to your remote repository.

```
git pull

git fetch upstream

git checkout master

git commit -m "[YOUR COMMIT MESSAGE HERE]"

git merge upstream/master master

git push origin master
```

## Debugging common errors
---
If your terminal happens to open up to Git's commit editor with the following message at the top,

```
Merge branch 'master' of [link of remote repository]
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
#
#
```

then you can either first edit that default commit message on the first line or leave it as it is, but then you want to
1. Hit the `esc` key to exit insert mode
2. Type `:wq`
	- `:` enters command mode
	- `w` is for write (save)
	- `q` is for quit
3. Hit the enter key to save the commit message and exit

---
If you notice after running the commands for fetching updates and pushing that your fork still does not have the new files for the day...

1. Check if your origin and upstream are correct by running `git remote -v`
2. If upstream is set to your fork instead of the class repository you can fix that by running
	```
	# Remove the current upstream
	git remote rm upstream
	# Add the correct upstream
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/BeaverWorksMedlytics2020/Week[NUMBER]_Public
	```
3. Double check to make sure you're all set by running `git remote -v` again, reference the forking section above to see what your origin and upstream should look like.
4. Now you should be able to start running the commands for keeping your fork up to date again starting with `git fetch upstream` etc
